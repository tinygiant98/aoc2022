Advent of Code 2022

Note:  A lot of these solutions likely suck due to time pressures or lack of knowledge on my part.  I won't go back to previous solutions to "fix" them, even if I come up with a better way to do it.  Should be a good reference for any learning I *might* be doing.

I heard about this exercise a few months ago and figured I'd give it a shot.  There is a typically an exponential decrease in the number of coders able to successfully solve all 25 days of AoC ... let's see how far I get.

Day 1:  Adding groups of numbers.  Pretty easy.

Day 2:  Rock, paper, scissors.  Very un-graceful/brute force method to solve this one, cuz I was busy and didn't want to think too hard.

Day 3:  Converting character sequences to numbers, then manipulating those numbers.  Haven't had a lot of practice with advanced sequence iterators and manipulators, so this was interesting.

Day 4:  4am after 15 hours of work and have to be back at work in eight hours means I put very little thought into this one and just brute-forced it.  Still, it worked on the first try!  Not proud of it, but done.

Day 5:  Combining regex and sequences.  Cool stuff and more elegant (though likely not very efficient) than the previous brute-force work.  The two methods for today's parts could've been combined into a single function to prevent repeated code, but I split them out to be able to more easily return answers from each part independently.

Day 6:  A surprisingly straight-forward solution to this one, and short.

Day 7:  Ouch.  Recursions and summations and reverse propogation, oh my.  Learned some new stuff today (Tables, string scans).  Needed some help to get over a summation hurdle, so had to consult the experts over on the nim forums.  Way more difficult that day 6, though I think this could be much simpler.  This doesn't bode well...
