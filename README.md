Advent of Code 2022

I heard about this exercise a few months ago and figured I'd give it a shot.  There is a typically an exponential decrease in the number of coders able to successfully solve all 25 days of AoC ... let's see how far I get.

Day 1:  Adding groups of numbers.  Pretty easy.

Day 2:  Rock, paper, scissors.  Very un-graceful/brute force method to solve this one, cuz I was busy and didn't want to think too hard.

Day 3:  Converting charcters to numbers, then manipulating those numbers.  Haven't had a lot of practice with advanced sequence iterators and manipulators, so this was interesting.
